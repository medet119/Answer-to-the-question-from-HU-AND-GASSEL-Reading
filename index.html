    Answer to the Question from Hu and Gassel's Reading

    <h1>How does changing the typography of an iconic logotype such as Google,
affect the way people think of the company, especially when drastic changes are being made?</h1>
    
    <p>I think that drastic changes in typography for such a global company as Google is a big and a very risky step step.
    You need to test and predict the outcome as far as possible becasue these types of changes can shift you bussines down or put
    it to another,more successful level. I beleive that Google were sure in what they were doing and it did not influence the company, maybe only 
    in a positive way. Today we can say that Google's shift was successful, people enjoy the new typo as well as a new theme applied </p>
